This is my repo for my website.

I moved from pointing my domain to a Tumblr over to GitHub Pages a few years ago. I would love to host my site on a Pi in my home, with something akin to Jekyll, it makes more sense to use GitHub to ensure that it works and doesn't require me to open up my LAN.

There's a project I've been dreaming up to have a 4G powered OpenWRT RPi router running all my automation and NAS needs, so maybe I'll self host on that.
