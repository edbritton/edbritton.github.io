<h1 align="center" id="top">Simplicity for accessibility</h1>

<p align="center"><big itemprop="description">If you make a website that is mainly text, it will be easier for visually imparred users. But there’s more we can do.</big></p>

<p>In a previous blog post of mine…</p>

<p><a href="Tablephobia ruined tables.html" accesskey="1" aria-label="Read that article here">Tablephobia ruined tables</a></p>

<p>…I lamented the lack of correct markup use when making tables of data on websites.</p>

<p>One thing about that post which probably matters more than my annoyance at bad copy-paste ability is that accessibility.</p>

<p>When a screen reader, <em aria-hidden="true">like VoiceOver built into Macs and iPhones for example,</em> tries to read crappy tables out to the user, it has the unenviable task of conveying complex (and no doubt boring) information to someone with words only. A “table” made up of random elements simply rearranged to <em>look</em> like a table will be impossible for someone listening.</p>

<p>This is a lesson in using simple and correct HTML with predictable hierarchy and <code>alt</code> text on images which need them.</p>

<h2>So that’s it then? Use tables and alt text?</h2>

<p>No. Think about what the experience is like for the visually impaired, heck turn on VoiceOver on your iPhone and navigate your site without looking at it!</p>

<p>Even this very simply made site was missing things initially. Navigating the list of blog posts was fine, but it wasn’t easy.</p>

<p>I flipped to VoiceOver and navigated my site, moving around was easy, some links could have been more descriptive, but the blog list came so quickly I had no idea if I was on the right page.</p>

<p>The main problem was one missing sentence: <q>Blog posts listed in reverse order, newest first.</q></p>

<p>This addition would give enough time and context that everything that followed was obvious.</p>

<p>But adding that text to the page feels superfluous to those who can already see that it’s a list of blog posts. Which is why I added the sentence in a <em>for screen readers only</em> section.</p>

<h2>Use <code>aria</code> attributes!</h2>

<p>ARIA attributes come to the rescue, and they’re not as confusing as you think.</p>

<p>If you need to add some text to better explain something on the page, simply add an <code>aria-label="A big list of my previous cats with photos."</code> attribute.</p>

<p>If you’ve put something which could be ignored by a screen reader, like a <code>marquee</code>, then trow in an <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>.</p>

<p>Simple!</p>

<p>There are more things you can do, but if you use just those two things, you’ll be doing better than bugger-all.</p>
